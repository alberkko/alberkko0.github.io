00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.253
Dietary iron.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.975
Iron is absorbed from food in the intestinal

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.800
lumen by the enterocytes in the duodenum.

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.098
There are two transport mechanisms for

00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:13.487
absorbing divalent iron (reduced form of iron)

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:15.577
or iron bound to a haem group

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.718
(haem iron, mainly animal-based)

00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:19.924
from food into enterocytes.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.640
Aditionally, there is a mechanism to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.167
convert trivalent iron (mainly plant-based)

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.060
into the divalent form.
