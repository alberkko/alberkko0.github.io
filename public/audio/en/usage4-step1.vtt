00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.213
Oxidative stress due to superoxide,

00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:06.983
a partially reduced oxygen species (PROS),

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:08.870
occurs in the body under normal

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:10.787
physiological conditions.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.610
This oxygen radical can have a destructive

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:15.734
effect on biological tissue and is

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.222
therefore purposely produced by the reduced

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:21.124
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.344
enzyme oxidase as part of the immune

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.791
system’s defence against pathogens.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.750
However, it is also formed as a byproduct

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:31.143
in the mitochondrial respiratory chain,

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:32.971
where it is rendered innocuous by the

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:35.791
enzyme superoxide dismutase and converted

00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:38.266
to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:41.415
Hydrogen peroxide is in itself stable but can

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.193
react with iron or copper and form radicals.
