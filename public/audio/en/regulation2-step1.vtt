00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:02.808
In the case of low intracellular iron

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:05.195
concentration, the iron-regulatory

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.180
proteins bind to the iron response

00:00:07.205 --> 00:00:09.878
element messenger RNA of ferritin,

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:11.952
divalent metal transporter 1,

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:14.004
transferin receptor and transferrin,

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:15.837
stimulating their production.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.939
On the other hand, expression of

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:20.340
ferroportin and ferritin is reduced.
