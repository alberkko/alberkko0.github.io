00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.968
Transferrin bound iron is transported

00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:04.746
from the bloodstream into the cells

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.613
via the transferrin receptor.

00:00:06.926 --> 00:00:09.026
Almost all cells express transferrin

00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:11.166
receptors that have a high affinity

00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:12.791
for iron-bound transferrin.
