Intracellular transport.

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.134
Within cells, iron is found in the

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:07.846
labile iron pool (LIP).

00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:10.844
Bound to chelators, the iron in the labile

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.470
iron pool is available for incorporation

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:15.800
into a variety of different proteins that

00:00:15.825 --> 00:00:18.827
are involved in many biological processes.

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.481
The proteins are either in the cytosol or

00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:23.353
in other cellular compartments.

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:26.069
Beware, if iron is bound to ferritin in the

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:27.969
enterocytes, it is lost in the

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:30.000
desquamation of the intestines

00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:33.673
(enterocyte life expectancy: 1 to 2 days).
