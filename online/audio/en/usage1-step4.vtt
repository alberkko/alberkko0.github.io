00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:02.928
The now acidic environment in the vesicle

00:00:02.953 --> 00:00:05.826
reduces the affinity of transferrin for iron.

00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:08.851
Trivalent iron dissociates from transferrin,

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:10.754
is then reduced to bivalent iron

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.894
and transported into the plasma of the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.253
consumer cell by divalent metal transporter 1.

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:18.888
On an intracellular level, iron is used

00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:21.301
in non-erythroid cells, in particular in

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:23.253
mitochondria metabolism.
