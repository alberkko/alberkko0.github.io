00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.515
Hydroxyl radicals are extremely reactive and there

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.593
is no defence mechanism to render them harmless.

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:08.833
In the case of a high steady-state

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:11.186
concentration of hydroxyl radicals,

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.580
lysosomes may rupture resulting in cell

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.705
damage that can lead to necrosis.
