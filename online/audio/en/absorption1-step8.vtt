<b> Transport via transferrin: </b>

00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:05.683
Iron is circulated bound to transferrin.

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:07.500
Each transferrin molecule can

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.886
bind two trivalent iron ions.

00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:11.372
Unbound transferrin is

00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:13.139
known as apotransferrin.
