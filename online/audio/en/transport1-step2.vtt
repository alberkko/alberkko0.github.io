00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:04.046
Trivalent iron binds to transferrin for transport.

00:00:04.383 --> 00:00:07.271
Under physiological conditions iron is always

00:00:07.296 --> 00:00:09.640
bound to transferrin in the circulation.

00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:13.121
Non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI)

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.528
is highly reactive and

00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:16.639
contributes to oxidative stress.
