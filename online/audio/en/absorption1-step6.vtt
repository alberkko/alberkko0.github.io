<b> Basolateral export via ferroportin: </b>

00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:06.344
Iron is exported from the enterocytes

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:07.646
via ferroportin.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.789
Only once this step is complete

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:11.806
is iron available to the body.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.035
Since iron cannot be actively

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.535
eliminated from the body,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.375
its absorption via ferroportin

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.399
is strictly regulated by hepcidin.
