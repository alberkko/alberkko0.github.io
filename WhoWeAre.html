                                Chevra Hatzalah (Hebrew for rescue), based moments away in New York, is the largest
                                volunteer Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agencies in the United States with over 1,100
                                volunteer EMTs, 200 paramedics and close to 100 ambulances spread throughout the New
                                York Metropolitan area. Hatzalah's dispatch center, the only non-governmental dispatch
                                center in the United States with the rights and capabilities to obtain blocked caller ID
                                information (similar to some 911 call centers) receives and dispatches close to 75,000
                                calls annually, which averages out to about one call every seven minutes 24/7/365.
                                Hatzalah’s response strategy focuses on dispatching the closest responders to the
                                patient's side from widely dispersed and fully equipped EMTs, paramedics, and
                                physicians.

                                Hatzalah was founded in Brooklyn, New York in 1965. It began when a prominent member of
                                the Jewish community had a heart attack and died while waiting for an ambulance to
                                arrive. In response to this tragedy, community members came together and started a
                                volunteer Emergency Medical response service, which they named Hatzalah (alternatively
                                spelled Hatzolah).
                                Today, Hatzalah is the largest volunteer EMS service in the world with operations in 16
                                countries amongst them, countless US Jewish communities including more than a dozen in
                                New Jersey. In early 2021, Bergen Hatzalah will humbly join that list.

                    <div class="row row3">
                        <div class="col-lg-6  d-flex justify-content-end">
                            <div class="text-one">
                                The team spearheading Bergen Hatzalah has a combined near century of Hatzalah and EMS
                                experience. They’ve all lived in Bergen County for more than 20 years and have witnessed
                                the need to bring Hatzalah’s life saving services to their communities. <br /><br />

                                The individuals who join Hatzalah are screened to assure they are respected members of
                                the community. After being chosen, they are put through a thorough training program that
                                includes EMT courses, practical training on ambulances and responding to emergency
                                calls, as well as equipment-specific training for the gear they carry. In order to serve
                                the community, all members must be certified as EMTs or licensed as
                                physicians.<br /><br />

                                They make a commitment to devote dozens, if not hundreds, of hours over the course of a
                                year to respond to anxious calls for help. And they do so on a volunteer basis, without
                                any thought of payment.<br /><br />

                                One of the reasons Hatzalah is able to respond to emergencies so quickly (2-4 minutes
                                from when the caller finishes dialing the hotline phone number) is the fact that the
                                responders live and work in our community, and respond directly from home, work, shul,
                                the grocery store and more. This enables the dedicated members of Hatzalah to reach any
                                point in the community within moments of the call for help being transmitted to them by
                                our state-of-the-art dispatch center.

                                In the secular community, two things about Hatzalah generally come as a surprise: that
                                it costs nothing and that its mission is to serve everyone, regardless of religion, race
                                or anything else.<br /><br />

                                Since Hatzalah volunteers work for free and community donations cover the cost of
                                medical equipment, the service and care is provided for free.<br /><br />

                                The dedicated volunteers are regular people, residents of our community with jobs, who
                                all share something special. They are trained and certified Emergency Medical
                                Technicians (known as EMT’s), Paramedics, and Physicians who are available 24 hours a
                                day to help a fellow neighbor.<br /><br />

                                They will routinely put their life on hold day or night to respond to emergency calls,
                                often leaving work in the middle of a busy day, their homes during Shabbat meals and in
                                the middle of the night, to provide help when needed.<br /><br />

                                Hatzalah is supported by its local community and donors. No donation is too small to
                                help us achieve our goal of providing top rapid response medical care within our
                                community.<br /><br />

                                Bergen Hatzalah Emergency Medical Services Inc., is currently in the process of becoming
                                501c3 tax exempt and as such, donations will soon be tax-deductible. If you’re
